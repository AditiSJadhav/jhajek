# Project Options and Suggestions

## Project List

Teams will need to pick a project subject.  The project scope can be from existing work you have done in classes or work you are doing on research projects currently.  The scope must be something that 5 or 4 people can contribute equally to over the course of 12 weeks and is not expected to 100% feature complete, but must be deployable and usable in all phases.

## Suggested Outlines

* Bug Overflow Q & A
  * Create a near feature complete copy of StackOverflow Q&A site
  * Instead of tech based Q & A, this will be based on identifying various types of insects
  * Create user accounts and profile post questions, images, and answers
  * Up and Down vote questions, track user points
  * Create storage solution for photos
* Project Factor
  * Create a system allowing users to create accounts and upload video, using a speech to text library (cloud based or opensource) to create text transcripts of these videos
  * Include solution for storage of videos and cost justification
  * Using a Spark/Hadoop/Solr/Lucene based application create an search engine to allow for searching of phrases and correlation with timestamp index in the corresponding video
* Flickr/Instagram hybrid internal photo search site
  * Create a flicker like tagged photo system allowing employees to search and modify stock photos (I will provide the photos to you)
  * Analyze real-time image rendering vs storing pre-rendered images
  * Create storage solution for images
* Virtual Reality (VR) based Networking Lab
  * Creating a VR based application that would be a self-contained network routing and switching app
  * Create visual demonstrations (lectures)
  * Create hands on networking and switching exercises to allow for virtual "hands-on" exercises
  * Using a small physical switching and routing setup, create a bridge to allow the virtual configuration to be applied in real life.
* Create and AI assistant for College Classes
  * Google Home, Amazon Echo, and or OpenSource Mycroft based assistant
  * Coordinate department syllabi to be injected into application (will be provided)
  * Create voice syntax for querying via voice and receiving spoken responses
  * Focus on VI/VX (voice interface, voice experience) to make the service as friendly as possible
* Other student defined projects
